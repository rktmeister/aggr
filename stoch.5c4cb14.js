The function maintains a record of the highest and lowest values over the `length` period and calculates the oscillator as \\( 100 \\times \\frac{\\text{close} - \\text{lowest}}{\\text{highest} - \\text{lowest}} \\). This indicator helps in identifying potential reversal points in the market, as values close to 100 indicate overbought conditions and values close to 0 indicate oversold conditions.\n\n*Note: The accuracy and relevance of the stochastic oscillator are contingent on the specified `length` and the quality of the price data. It's essential to interpret this indicator in conjunction with other tools and market factors for effective trading decisions.*\n";export{e as default};
