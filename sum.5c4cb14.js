const n="```ts\nsum(value: number): number\n```\n\nComputes the running total sum by adding the current value to the accumulated sum.\n\n## Parameters\n\n- `value`: The current numerical value to be added to the sum.\n\n## Returns\n\n- The updated total sum including the current value.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `sum` function is designed to continuously aggregate a numerical value, providing a running total. This function is essential for situations where accumulating a sequence of values is necessary, such as in financial contexts for summing transaction amounts, aggregating sales figures, or in data analysis for totalizing measurements. Each call to the function adds the new value to the existing sum, returning the updated total. The simplicity and utility of this function make it a versatile tool in various computational and analytical scenarios.\n\n*Note: The function maintains a running total, effectively adding each new input value to the cumulative sum. It is important to consider this continual accumulation when using the function in time-series analysis or other applications where a running total is pertinent.*\n";export{n as default};
